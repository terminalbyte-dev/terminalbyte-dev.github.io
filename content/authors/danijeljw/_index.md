<p>Hey there! I'm DJ, your friendly C# developer based in sunny Sydney, where I juggle coding cloud infrastructure with side projects that keep my tech brain buzzing. When I'm not optimizing code, you'll find me indulging in my love for chicken schnitzel, mangoes, cherries, and coconut.</p>
<br />
<p>I'm all about enjoying Christmas downunder with a warm festive vibe, though the North Pole is calling my name for a future adventure. My Spanish journey is a bit of a challenge, but I'm tackling it one book at a time.</p>
<br />
<p>At home, I'm all about the cozy lifeâ€”snacking on almonds, soaking up the vibes, and binging Star Trek: TNG on the couch while everyone else sleeps. Follow my adventures on my socials! ðŸš€ðŸŒ´ðŸŽ„ðŸ›¸</p>
