To change your Windows domain password from any machine connected to the domain, follow these steps:

1. Open PowerShell.
1. Run the following command:

```powershell
net user $env:USERNAME <new_password> /domain
```

Replace `<new_password>` with your desired new password.

This command updates your password on the domain controller without requiring your current password. Itâ€™s a good practice to update your password regularly, such as monthly, to maintain security.
